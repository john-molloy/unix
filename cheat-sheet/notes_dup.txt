A double hyphen prefixes a single, multicharacter option.

Consider this example:
  tar -czf
In this example, -czf specifies three single-character flags: c, z, and f.

Now consider another example:
  tar --exclude
In this case, --exclude specifies a single, multicharacter option named 
exclude. The double hyphen disambiguates the command-line argument, 
ensuring that tar interprets it as exclude rather than a combination 
of e, x, c, l, u, d, and e.
